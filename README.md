Database

The program organizes multiple databases by making them into directories. These databases can be created and named using the CREATE DATABASE function and it will give a warning if you try to create another database that has the same name as a database already in your current database. Tables can be created using the CREATE TABLE function and it will create a table with the given name. Tables in the same database will be unable to have the same name and the program will give a warning if you attempt to do so.

To run use the command:
python3 database.py < PA1_t.sql

PA1_t.sql is the test file
